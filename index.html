                        <h2>Bali, Indonesia</h2>
                        <p> Selamat pagi! Every morning was a 'good morning!' during our trip to Bali this past July. My wife, Nicole, and I were thrilled at the opportunity to get a taste of the luxorious life for a mere fraction of what it would cost us in the 'Western World.' Our days were full of sand, sun and delicous food (and some strange cuisine as well) as we travelled to and fro aboard our trusty rental scooter. The contrast between the crowded city and calm coastline was extreme but we always found ourselves well fed, relaxed and satisfied each evening we retreated within our temporary bungallow home, until the next 'Selamat pagi!' greeting could be heard.

                                <h2>Cambodia</h2>
                                <p>Destination #2 on our journey through SE Asia was Cambodia. Thanks to a good friend who is a local to the area, we were able to navigate through our time there with ease and enjoyment. Some of the best dishes I've ever eaten were on this stop of our trip, yet also, some of the worst.. Our days were split between local markets and Phnom Penh hotspots, and famous temples and tourist attractions that found us in the midst of foreigners like ourselves. Wild monkeys were not uncommon to be encountered (they are not as nice as expected) and the skill of bargaining is put to work on a daily basis with every purchase from a local vendor trying to make an extra buck off of an unsuspecting tourist. To sum up my Cambodian experience I will leave you with this, I had to check an extra bag from all the local market loot, and I had to wear my comfy pants on the plane (so much food).

                                    <h2>Seoul, South Korea</h2>
                                    <p>Seoul, South Korea is a clean, well oiled machine. Housed high above the city in a skyscraper hotel, we looked out upon the many business men and women scurrying on in the midst of their day. We travelled the impressive subway system alongside students, families and professionals alike, all with their face in their phone, only looking up long enough to flash a slight smile. The quality of South Korea was unbeknownst to me prior to our visit, but the impression that was left on me from the city is second to none. For crying out loud, even their garbage trucks were clean! Seoul is the only city where you can drink coffee with a leemur on one block, sing karaoke on the next, and pig out at a fresh sushi bar at anytime of day. Sure the city wasn't perfect, but to me it's a perfect piece of the puzzle that is SE Asia and a proper finish to a fabulous trip.
